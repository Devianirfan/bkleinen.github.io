If you just have a quick question or need something signed for Baf&ouml;g just stop by during the office hours. 
If you have questions regarding BAF&ouml;G, you might want to read [this](bafoeg/index.html)first and discover that you don't need to come to see me at all.

If you want to discuss your thesis topic or work, please [make an appointment by putting your name in the wiki](https://github.com/bkleinen/bkleinen.github.io/wiki) to avoid long lines during office hours.
