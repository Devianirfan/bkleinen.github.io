### 7. The first Kara Clock!

Now, with your completed DigitalDisplayKara, the first Kara Clock can be build!

Open `ClockDisplayWorld1` - it contains three DigitDisplayKaras: one for minutes, one for ten minutes, and one for hours.
Experiment a bit with it!

Showing 24 hours is difficult though - 24 leaves would be too much, using two digits - one for 10 hours, one for each hour - would need to toggle the 
limit for the single hour DigitDisplayKara between 10 and 4.
