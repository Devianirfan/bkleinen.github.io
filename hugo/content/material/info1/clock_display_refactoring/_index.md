# Reflections and Improvements on the Clock Display Example
{{<prev_next >}}

I have been working with the ClockDisplay example as shown in the Textbook ["Objects First with Java: A Practical Introduction Using Bluej." by David J Barnes and Michael Kölling][2] (Barnes and Kölling 2017) for a while now. While the book contains many great examples that allow the discussion of a broad range of object oriented design,
this example has some particular problems.

This page is about my approach(es) to improve the ClockDisplay example.
