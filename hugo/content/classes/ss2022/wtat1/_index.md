# WTAT 1 - Agile Web Development Summer Term 2022
## Welcome!

WTAT1 - Agile Web Development is a class that combines learning web development with an Agile Project.

Within the class you will design and develop a web application within a small team. Your team is free to choose the application topic of the web application, while the technologies are set.

Throughout the project, you will build features into your project that allow you to learn and practice certain aspects of web development and the technology used. See the Schedule and the Topics list for details.

The class will be conducted on site at HTW every Friday afternoon. There will be no streaming and no recordings. To prepare the Friday meeting with other teams and with the teacher, you will need study various topics
and produce code during the week, first individually, then together with your team.

## Class Contents

- Agile Development
- Scrum Methods, Ceremonies and Artefacts
- Web Application Basics
- View Templates, Model View Controller
- Node, Express, Javascript
- Persistence, MongoDB
- Authentication and Web Security
- Vue.js
- Real Time Communication/Web Sockets
- Continuous Deployment

## Class Structure

The class will require four different kinds of activity every week:

1. Individual Study: you start by studying the topic of the week individually.
   This usually consists of reading one book chapter and about one topic on agile development.

2. Lernteam: you work together mainly on the programming part and clarifying questions that came up during individual study.
   Thus, your team should commit to one weekly time slot to work together. This slot should be sometime before the Friday meetings.

3. Exercise: During the Friday exercise meeting (14:00 - 15:30 **or** 17:30 - 19:00, depending on your admission), you present your solution to the development topic of the week and we discuss any questions that came up.
   Weekly status reports and final commits on the sprints are due on Friday 22:00.

4. Class: During the Friday class meeting (15:45 - 17:15 for all participants), 2-3 students will take turns at presenting a previously agreed web technology topic. This serves to put development activities into a broader context. There will also be background presentations from the teacher

## Presentations

You need to prepare and present a short talk about one web technology-related topics in a small group (2-3 persons). These presentations will be assigned during the class on April 22nd.
