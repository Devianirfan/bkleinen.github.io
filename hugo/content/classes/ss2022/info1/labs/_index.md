## Lab Exercises

The labs are structured in a Pre-Lab section and the core lab assignment.
Work on the Pre-Lab before coming to the lab!

## Grading: Lab Reports

You will need to write a report each week, which should not be more than 5 pages and
in PDF format, with your name on it. The report must be in English or German. In consists of two parts:

1. The report on the lab assignment, spell-checked and using complete sentences,
explaining what you did in the
exercise session, that is, the process. Screenshots are welcome. This part
may be written together with others in your team and exchanged within your team.
Thus, include the name of all authors in this part.

2. a reflection on what you learned during the session, which is your personal,
individual summary.

Additionally, you upload a zip of your solution's source code.


Both must be submitted individually to the Moodle area by 22.00 before the next lab.

## What happens in a lab?

Programming is something you can&#8217;t learn out of a book &#8211; you have
try out things yourself and practice! Therefore, this class will have lots of
exercises. In the Labs you will have opportunity to work on them, and, most
importantly, **ask questions** or **discuss it with others** if something is
unclear to you or you are stuck somewhere.

## Structure of the Exercises

Each exercise has a **Pre-Lab** section. preperatory work that you are expected
to **complete** - together with reading through the whole exercise - **before coming to lab**.

## Group Work

Labs and lab reports will be done in groups of three. These groups will be formed at
random at the beginning of each lab. Each group member gets the same grade for the lab report
that gets handed in.

## I could not attend the lab...

Please post in the appropriate Moodle forum. You will be assigned a group. I expect
you to do the exercises anyway and hand in a lab report.

## I can generally not attend the lab on any specific day...

You can switch during the "Restplatzbelegungszeitraum". Find someone
who wants to swap places with you, then come talk to me (Linda).

## I have another problem!
Talk to me! You can even do it anonymousely on Moodle.
