- Set up Continuous Integration with
    - Automated Tests: Which tests should you have to most effectively ensure
      that your app is still working after a change? Which are the most important
      features, how can you test most effectively? (think UI Tests vs Unit test, see [The Practical Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html))
    - Code Quality Assurance - find and test one code quality assurance tool
    - How does your deployment pipeline look like? which steps are automatic, which
      require manual interaction and if, which one?
