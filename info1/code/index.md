## Note on Code Examples

You find all Code Examples - those from the lectures as well as those for the exercises - on github:
[https://github.com/htw-imi-info1](https://github.com/htw-imi-info1)

Please note that this organization ([htw-imi-info1](https://github.com/htw-imi-info1)) contains all repositories from former semesters. I might update them slightly before class, so if you download them ahead, you might want to subscribe to the repository to be notified in case something changes.

Also note that you don't need to know how to use git in order to use them - there's a download zip button for each repository somewhere.

If I make changes to the source code in class, I commit them into a branch named class-&lt;date&gt; - you can select this branch on the github page and see exactly what I've changed in the commits.
