# Discount Usability

The Nielsen Norman Group maintains a great web site with a wealth of information and material about Usability, User Centered Design and User Experience. Starting with [Discount Usability 30 Years](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/discount-usability-30-years/) read about either - or all - the three mentioned methods: simplified user testing with 5 users, early test of paper prototypes, and heuristic evaluation. Your goal is to learn enough about either one of this three methods to apply it within a project.
