Unit 4 - Building a User Model - is a rather long unit, and you will have two weeks or sprints time
to work through it. The technical topics are:

- CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete actions on Models in the Rest architectural style
- Validations
- Model Associations

It discusses CRUD by creating CRUD functionality via model, views, controller and routes for
the User model.


You will need a user model for authentication, and you can just copy the user model created in the book, and adapt it such that it fits to your application domain.

Find one or more stories to implement at least one

- validation
- model association
- index
- create
- read
- update
- delete

You will find that not all models are in need of all crud actions at least not associated with one
dedicated view or input form.

You can spread the stories and tasks over the 2 weeks & sprints as you like,
but it's probably easier if you do it in the order of the book (as listed above).

Write at least one test for each story.
Don't forget to update your seeds.

__don't overlook chapter 17.2., Testing models in REPL__ - testing parts of your application interactively can save you lots of time!
