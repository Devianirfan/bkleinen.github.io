# WTAT 1 - Agile Web Development
## Welcome!

WTAT1 - Agile Web Development is a class that combines learning web development with an Agile Project.

Within the class you will design and develop a web application within a small team. Your team is free to choose the topic as you like.

Throughout the project, you will build features into your project that allow you to learn and practice certain aspects of web development. See the Schedule and the Topics list for details.

## Meetings and Due Dates

Meetings are scheduled for Tuesdays - Lectures @ 12:15-13:45,
Labs 15.45-17:15.

Lectures are done as flipped classroom: You need to prepare the topic beforehand,  The lecture will be used for answering questions, working on example exercises and coordinating practice time in labs.

During distance learning, which may be for the whole term, I will make use of the lab time for individual sessions with the teams.

Note that there is required reading to read *before* class.

We meet each week for 2 x 1,5hrs. Although the schedule is split up into lecture and lab (SU+Ãœ) we
will split up the time between lectures, assignments and practice and time for project work into your
team more dynamically within these 3 hours.

## Grades

To pass the class, you will need to work regularly on the topic and your project:

* you need to turn in a brief status report every week about your project as a group.
* There will be 2 larger project reports that will be graded with stars.
* There will be occasional Moodle Quizzes during the lecture.
* there will be some kind of exam - this needs to be decided upon.

Your grade in WTAT1 will be a weighted mixture of the evaluated graded elements of the course.

Currently it is unclear wether on-site examinations will be possible at the end of term. Thus, the definite grading and examination terms will be defined later as usual.

Weekly status reports are due Sunday 22:00.

s. Those are not graded, but you need to turn in viable reports for each topic approximately every two weeks.
* Quizzes: after the completion of each topic, there will be a brief Moodle quiz about the topic covered. If you choose to participate in those quizzes, they may count as 50% of your grade
* Exam: There will be a Moodle exam at the end of term. It either counts
    * 50% with the points from the quizzes as other 50%
    * 100% if you get a better grade this way either because you didn't participate in the quizzes or have achieved fewer points than in the exam (yay! automatically. You don't even have to choose.)
