# WTAT 1 - Agile Web Development
## Welcome!

WTAT1 - Agile Web Development is a class that combines learning web development with an Agile Project.

Within the class you will design and develop a web application within a small team. Your team is free to choose the topic.

Throughout the project, you will build features into your project that allow you to learn and practice certain aspects of web development and the technology used. See the Schedule and the Topics list for details.

## Meetings and Due Dates

Meetings are scheduled for Tuesdays - Lectures @ 12:15-13:45,
Labs @ 15.45-17:15.

Lectures are done as flipped classroom: You need to prepare the topic beforehand,  The lecture will be used for answering questions, working on example exercises and coordinating practice time in labs.

During distance learning, which may be for the whole term, I will make use of the lab time for individual sessions with the teams.

Note that there is required reading to read *before* class.

We meet each week for 2 x 1,5hrs. Although the schedule is split up into lecture and lab (SU+Ãœ) we
will split up the time between lectures, assignments and practice and time for project work into your
team more dynamically within these 3 hours.

## Digital Media

Even more than usual, there will be several digital media things supporting this
class. You find the links to Moodle, GitHub, the Wiki and LSF in the top menu as "External Links".

* The class structure, assignments and other things that can and should be publicly available are on this web page
* Discussion Forums, Material that can't be made publicly available, Links to Videos, Quizzes etc are in Moodle
* Collaborative Knowledge Production will be done in the Wiki
* Source Code will be on GitHub.

## Grades

As it will remain unclear for a while how exams can be done this term, the grading criteria are not set
completely yet. If we can do exams at the end of term, I will do that. If not, I may relay on your book
chapter and longer project reports for grading. I will decide on the points/percentages given for the class components described below in early May.

Independent of grading details, you will need to work regularly on the topic and your project in order to pass the class:

* you need to turn in a brief status report every week about your project as a group. You may miss one without penalty, for each more missed 2% will be deducted from your overall points.
* There may be 2 larger project reports that will be graded with stars.
* There may be occasional Moodle Quizzes during the lecture.
* You need to add one page to the web technology handbook in the wiki.
* there will probably be some kind of exam


Currently it is unclear wether on-site examinations will be possible at the end of term. Thus, the definite grading and examination terms will be defined later as usual.

Weekly status reports are due Sunday 22:00.

Your grade in WTAT1 will be a weighted mixture of the evaluated graded elements of the course.

s. Those are not graded, but you need to turn in viable reports for each topic approximately every two weeks.
* Quizzes: after the completion of each topic, there will be a brief Moodle quiz about the topic covered. If you choose to participate in those quizzes, they may count as 50% of your grade
* Exam: There will be a Moodle exam at the end of term. It either counts
    * 50% with the points from the quizzes as other 50%
    * 100% if you get a better grade this way either because you didn't participate in the quizzes or have achieved fewer points than in the exam (yay! automatically. You don't even have to choose.)
