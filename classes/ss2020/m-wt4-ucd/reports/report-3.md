## Paper Prototypes in their current state

Include Fotos or other appropriate Form of Documentation of the paper prototypes,
Interpretation Notes of the Interview Sessions and Documentation / Changes you
made based on these interviews.
Include a brief reflection on how you worked with paper prototypes in a remote way (if you did).

# Final Report

The final Report should present your work for this course as a whole, with
an emphasis of the product concept as you've presented it in the final presentation.

Please include the first two reports as well as your presentation slides,
compiling a coherent report on the complete project.

The only new content would be the evaluation of the prototypes as a special
section, and probably a rewrite / addition to the product concept as a result of
this evaluation.
