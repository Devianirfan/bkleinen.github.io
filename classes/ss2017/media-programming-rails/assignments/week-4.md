### Reading
For next week, read about rolling your own authentication in rails:
* [Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial Chapter 8](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/basic_login)


# Week 4

## Authentication /Login & Logout

  1. Add a user model and set it up with encrypted password
  2. Add Sessions, Login and Logout to your application
  3. Restricting Access to Some Pages

Again, see the [example project](../example-project/week-4) for clarification on what to do.
Note that this is not a complete thing, as you don't need to implement signup. It's just about
getting an idea about how session management and login in rails might work. For a real life web
application you should use one of the available frameworks, like devise.

## Reading for next week

* [Working with JavaScript in Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html)
