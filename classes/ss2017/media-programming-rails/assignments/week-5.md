# Week 5

## AJAX

Find a place where a little bit of JavaScript is useful in your Application. You find a couple
of examples in the [Working with JavaScript in Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html) Guide.

See my [example project](../example-project/week-5).

Upload a PDF Report describing what you did (I don't want to have to figure out what
you did from your source code) including a link to the git repository (or, the
complete repository.)
make sure you have tagged all versions with the corresponding week, e.g.

    git tag week5
