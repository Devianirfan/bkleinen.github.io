## Sprint 02: Persistence with Mongo

Based on Unit 3, "Connecting to a Database", you'll implement persistence with Mongo DB and Mongoose.
The functionality implemented will be showing listings and single items of one resource, as well as creating new records (no editing yet).

As usual, select a story or two you will implement using the new technological features.
You will create a full CRUD (Create/read/update/delete) in later Sprints.

### Example Application

With this sprint, you can pretty much follow the book. See my doc in the readme for the example app:

https://github.com/htw-imi-wtat1/module-handbook-2021-2021/blob/main/README.md#sprint-02

### Status Report

Write up a brief status report containing:

- Your Project Name
- The Names of all People on the Team
- The Stories you've implemented
- the url of your git repositories
- your revised backlog, keeping the implemented stories at the top marked as "Sprint 01 - Done" or "Sprint 01 - in progress"

and submit it as .txt or .pdf to moodle with the Filename:
Group_X_project_name_Sprint02.pdf or Group_X_project_name_Sprint02.txt
