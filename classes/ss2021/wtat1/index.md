# WTAT 1 - Agile Web Development Summer Term 2021
## Welcome!

WTAT1 - Agile Web Development is a class that combines learning web development with an Agile Project.

Within the class you will design and develop a web application within a small team. Your team is free to choose the application topic of the web application, while the technologies are set.

Throughout the project, you will build features into your project that allow you to learn and practice certain aspects of web development and the technology used. See the Schedule and the Topics list for details.

The class will be conducted as Lernteamcoaching. You will study the topics first individually, then together with your team, preparing a weekly coaching session with the teacher.

## Class Structure

We are heading for yet another term of distance-learning.
The class will be structured as Learnteam coaching - with three phases:

1. Individual Study: you start by studying the topic of the week individually.
   This usually consists of reading one book chapter and about one topic on agile development.

2. Lernteam: you work together mainly on the programming part and clarifying questions that came up during individual study.

3. Lernteam coaching: Within the learnteam coaching, you present your work and solution (in progress) and we discuss questions that came up.
   Lernteam coaching will be within individually scheduled appointments scheduled via moodle.
   Weekly status reports and final commits on the sprints are due Friday 22:00.
