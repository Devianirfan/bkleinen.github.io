## Welcome!

Informatics 1 is an introduction to object-oriented programming using the Java
language. In this class we will be using [BlueJ](https://bluej.org/) as development environment.
You will learn about writing programs, designing simple algorithms, about
control structures, data types and structures and last not least object oriented
programming - objects and classes.

## Language

This class will be held in a mixture of German and English.
Most written material will be in English.
You are free to choose German or English for your written assignments.

## Class Structure and Meetings

Under non-corona-circumstances, the class would consist of 2x2h of
lectures and 2h of lab per week, accompanied by a 2h Tutorial.
The details - time and rooms - would be found in LSF, see link above in the external links menu.

Due to the pandemic, this class will be held completely in a distance format
with the method of Learnteam Coaching. You will work on one Chapter of the textbook
first individually and then together with your Learning Team, aided by
the actual Learnteam coaching by one of the instructors. Also, you will
work on one Lab Assignment every week. See the [Schedule](./schedule) for the
exact plan and links to the materials.

There will be a "kick off" to the following week each Friday at 9:45 in Zoom
(link to Zoom can be found in Moodle) with a brief introduction to the topic by
Prof. Kleinen and to the lab assignment by Linda Fernsel.
Your second weekly meeting will be within your learning team;
the third one will be the learnteam coaching done by either Linda Fernsel and
me.

Furthermore, there will be a Tutorial for everyone once a week held by Eve Schütze.

## Grades

TBD.


Your grade in Info1 will be a weighted mixture of the evaluated elements of the
 course. The partial grades will be assessed as follows and then graded according to the [Grading Scale]({{ site.baseurl }}/studies/grading/grading-scale).

* Lab Reports: 50%
* Exam: 50%
* Lecture summaries: 8%


### Lecture Summaries (aka Lecture Notes)
In the Moodle collaboration room you can find a section called "Lecture summaries".
You are expected to write 5-10 complete sentences summarizing each lecture, or
a handwritten/drawn A4 Paper (e.g. Sketchnotes).

Lecture summaries are due at 22.00 on Monday for both lectures of the past week.
They are either done or not done. I expect you to do 12 out of 13 out of all
to get the full 8%.
If I find plagiarisms of lecture summaries (especially from the Wikipedia),
you will not get any credit for **any** lecture summary.

#### I couln't attend class! What to do about the Lecture Summary?

If you couldn't attend the lecture, you can still write a summary: Ask your
mates what we did in class, and read up the according chapter(s) in the book,
and write or draw a summary. Please put a brief note on the page that you
did this based on your own reading.

### Lab Reports
You find detailled information about them on the [Lab Page](labs/)

### Exam

There will be a 2-hour online examination at the end of the term. The examination will cover Java programming and conceptual understanding in ways that may be difficult to assess during the laboratory sessions. The exam will be an on-line exam with two parts, a multiple-choice part and an essay / programming part. Please consult LSF for the definite date and time.

## Textbook and Materials

### Textbook

This Class is based on the Textbook **Objects First with Java - A Practical
Introduction using BlueJ**, Pearson Education. 6th edition by David Barnes and
Michael Kölling. [Pearson Book Page](https://www.pearson-studium.de/objects-first-with-java-a-practical-introduction-using-bluej-global-edition.html)

There is a German translation available: Barnes, David J., Kölling, Michael: Java lernen mit BlueJ. Pearson,  2017, 6. Auflage. [Pearson Book Page](https://www.pearson-studium.de/java-lernen-mit-bluej_4.html)

There are copies available in the library, and you can also obtain an older edition - examples and chapter order vary, but the general content is mostly the same apart from the newer chapters on lambdas and streams.

See also [https://www.bluej.org/objects-first/](https://www.bluej.org/objects-first/)

If you prefer Videos, [David Barnes has recently recorded a new set of class videos][BarnesVideos].

### Java Tutorials

There are many Java Tutorials out there on the web on the topics we cover. Many will prove useful, however, also practice to gauge the quality
and applicability of your findings before relying on them.

A comprehensive resource for the Java language are the [Tutorials by Sun/now Oracle][7]; especially the [Trail &#8220;Learning the Java Language&#8221;][8].
