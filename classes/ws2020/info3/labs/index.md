## Exercises
* [Exercise 01 - Installation, Git and Ruby](lab-01-startup)
* [Exercise 02 - Use Cases and Class Diagrams](lab-02-usecases-class)
* [Exercise 03 - Sequence Diagrams and State Machine Diagrams](lab-03-sequence-state)
* [Exercise 04 - Testing](lab-04-testing)
* [Exercise 05 - Legacy Code - Refactoring to Patterns](lab-05-legacy)
* [Exercise 06 - Rails First Steps](lab-06-rails-1)
* [Exercise 07 - Rails Associations and Internationalization](lab-07-rails-2)

In the Info3 lab, we will do quite different things:

 * Design a Software System with the UML
 * Practice Software Testing
 * Fix a weird piece of legacy software
 * Get our feet wet with Ruby and Ruby on Rails and marvel at the patterns we find in there

There will be 7 exercises. The exercises will either be written reports - lab reports - or the documents you produce in your design with UML, usually not the source code itself. I might, however, ask to turn it in as well.

You are required to work on the exercises and turn them in **groups of  3 people**. Submissions are done in Moodle, **no late submissions** are allowed this term. Always hand in what you have on time.

## Oral Tests
* Mandatory
* 1 oral test per group per lab assignment (except Lab02, Lab05)
* 10 minutes
* Gain up to 3 points per test
* During the next lab with a new assignment
* Order of groups is decided at random

You should be able to:
* explain your results
* explain your code
* answer questions about subjects of a lab

If you can not attend the test, talk to me asap. We will try to find a solution together.

## Lab Hand Ins
* Hand in a Lab Report 
* Depending on the lab also hand in a link to the repository
* Mandatory
* Gain up to 2 points per report
More info about the Lab Hand Ins can be found on the [Labs](labs) page.

## Peer Reviews
Lab02 and Lab05 will be peer-reviewed. There will be no oral tests for these labs, but each person will need to review 3 other lab reports. Each review will earn you X points.
