## Teams
You are required to work on the exercises and turn them in **teams of  3 people**. 

## Submissions
You need to 
* work with repositories for your code. Upload your **repository** in the fitting folder at https://gl-imi.f4.htw-berlin.de/info3-wise2020.
* if you produced code: share a link to your repository in the Moodle hand in field (the text field)
* write a **report** about what you did and your results. Upload your report in the Moodle hand in field (the file field)
* participate in the **oral test** about the lab (not Lab02 and Lab05)
* Only Lab02 and Lab05: Take part in the **Peer Reviews**

Only one person per team has to do the hand in. 

**No late submissions** are allowed this term. Always hand in what you have on time. If a problem is blocking your work, I expect you to ask me about it in the second week of the assignment.

## Reports
I trust you to have a feeling for what belongs in a good report. The following requirements of form are new and prepare you for scientific work:
* You write in correct, complete sentences
* You write about facts and your tone is neutral
* You cite your sources appropriately ([How to do that?](https://people.f3.htw-berlin.de/Professoren/Pruemper/pdf/RichtlinienHaus-undDiplomarbeiten.pdf))
* You don't write more than necessary

## Oral Tests
The progress you make in each lab except lab02 and lab05 will be verified with 10-minute oral tests (1 per group per assignment).

You should be able to:
* explain your results
* explain your code
* answer questions about subjects of a lab

The order of groups is decided at random. The tests usually take place during the next lab with a new assignment. If you can not attend the test, talk to me asap. We will try to find a solution together.

## Peer Reviews
Lab02 and Lab05 will be peer-reviewed. There will be no oral tests for these labs, but each person will need to review 3 other lab reports.
