## IN_VISIBLE - Contextual and System Design for a Community Prototype (M6/M11)

Barne Kleinen, Kamalanetra Johnson, René_ Hornstein
### Project IN_VISIBLE

When we are denied expressing our identity and participating in education we become invisible.

IN_VISIBLE is an interactive, bottom ­up, visualization tool and open mapping prototype that monitors the changing landscape of access, inclusion, and exclusion from public spaces, services and private institutions for transgender communities.  

IN_VISIBLE stands for Inclusion and Visibility.

The first mapping will focus on the monitoring of higher education spaces in Germany. The second mapping of the prototype will monitor health care access (start Spring 2020).  

IN_VISIBLE first design was presented at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), in the frame of the conference Technology for Development by Pineapple Laboratories.  Science, Technology and Innovation combined can substantially accelerate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. SDGs are part of Resolution 70/1 of the United Nations General Assembly. We contribute to goals # 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11: quality of education, gender equality, good jobs and economic growth, innovation and infrastructure, reduce inequalities and sustainable communities. The Parameters we want to measure will be related to the Inclusion criteria List formulated by Rain Hornstein.
### Goal and Scope of the Praxisprojekt IMI M WS 2019/20

Goal of the Project will be to design and build a prototype for the In_Visible Project that

* implements a useful and viable first set of data entry, visualization and administration functionality based on a brief contextual design process conducted during the project

* provides a robust system architecture and deployment strategy that will be the basis for expansion during the second and possible later phases of the IN_VISIBLE project
