# Design and Evaluation I: Visioning, Product Concepts and Storyboards

## Visioning

Start with creating (or completing) the three input lists:
* hot ideas
* issues
* technology

### Create 4-7 Visions
Start the visions from hot ideas. Assign the roles
* Pen
* Poker
* Team

And alternate them between the visions such that each of you gets to practice each role.
If you don't have a Flipchart available, use a A3-Paper in the middle of the table.

### Evaluation

Evaluate your Visions using Structed Evaluation with likes/dislike lists and green/yellow/red lights as described in chapter 11.

## Product Concepts

Create at least three Product Concepts. Evaluate and enhance them using the cool drilldown method.

## Storyboards

Create at least one storyboard per person in your team.
Details will be described later.

*you create one PDF in the group with all names, and each member of the
group needs to upload this (same) report to moodle*

*please name the reports like your group, e.g. group01-assignment03.pdf*
