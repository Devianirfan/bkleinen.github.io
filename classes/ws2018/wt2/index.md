# Web Technology 2 - Usability

- Work in Progress -

Important note: I'll probably open a second Lab for the class
such that all interested can get a spot.

If you want to get in you need to attend in the first week (9.10.) to hear
the plan for the class and in the second week (16.10, if you're still
interested) for topics and group assignments. We will split the lab in
two groups after that if still necessary.
