title: Schedule

---



Please note that there will be no Info1 classes in the first week due to introductionary things.
 In the second week, there will also be no lectures and due to a conference -
 I found no sensible time slot to move our first lab to, so we'll be starting off in the third week.

This schedule is tentative and subject to change!
