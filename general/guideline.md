The assignments will clearly state wether you need to hand in a PDF, source code or both. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

*   if both PDF and source code have to be submitted, upload two files: a PDF and a zip with the source code. If the Source Code is within one single file, you can upload this directly instead of the Zip. Please do **not** include the PDF in the ZIP file.
*   If only a PDF has to be submitted, hand in the PDF. If only source code has to be submitted, hand in only the zip/single file.
*   **Include the names** of all people in the group** at the top** of the PDF \*and\*** at the top** of each (relevant) source code file. If you collaborated with further people, do state so **at the beginning** of the files.
*   If you hand in your work in other formats, e.g. Word file instead of PDF, rar archive instead of zip, you might be lucky that I will grade it anyway if the computer I happen to work on opens it without complaints. If not, I will not go through the hassle of installing other software / watch my mac opening MS Word and might decide to not grade your submission.
*   I **will assign 0 points** to all work handed in by more than one group/person without stating the names of the others. That is, if you work on an exercise together with others, or help them with it, make sure all of you make that &#8220;collaboration&#8221; clear in their reports, and do so yourself in your report, otherwise you might receive 0 points as well.
*   **Submit your complete work on time**. There is no point in emailing me if you didn&#8217;t. Everybody has a cold now and then, but if you miss just one week (and your group wasn&#8217;t able to upload it for you&#8230;) you still have the chance of getting enough points for a 1.0 as there is enough slack in the grading. If you become seriously ill and miss more than one week, make sure you collect medical certificates (Ã¤rztliche Atteste) immediately and email me/talk to me asap and we will find a solution.
*   **Submissions not adhering to these guidelines will not be graded.**
