My main areas of interest are

* Web Technology
* Continuous Deployment and DevOps
* Agile Development
* User Centered Design and Usability

And especially all intersections of these areas.

If you have an idea for a topic that fits into these areas, come and talk to me.

I'm also happy to supervise topics that are based within a company, but I don't
usually sign NDAs.

The following is a Collection of Ideas for Topics and things that I would like
to see and use.

## Thesis Topics in the area of DevOps

## IMI and Supporting Learning

### IMI-Dashboard/Calendar

Identify relevant and important information for IMI-Students and find ways to present it
to them - that might be a dashboard, but also include other forms of hardware.
There is a rails-based prototype

### Search for the IMI-Map

Develop a search algorithm to find internships for the IMI-Map.

## Supporting Agile Development

### Topic Driven Backlog: Deployment and Usability Testing

Continuation of the Topic Driven Backlog Project: Plan and implement in a course.
