My main areas of interest are

* User Centered Design and Usability
* Agile Development
* Web Technology
* Continuous Deployment and DevOps
* Teaching Computer Science


And all intersections of these areas.

If you have an idea for a topic that fits into these areas, come and talk to me.

I'm also happy to supervise topics that are based within a company, but I usually
don't sign NDAs.

The following is a Collection of Ideas for Topics and things that I would like
to see and use.

Most Topics can be done with different focusses on either user research/design,
implementation or evaluation.

## Classroom Tools / Agile Development

#### Classroom Survey& Feedback Tool

There are many Survey-Tools out there, but no open source one. Topic of the Thesis would be
to develop an easy to use survey and feedback-tool for Classrooms, either to
collect information in a larger group of people, or as interactive element /
feedback tool on the learning process.

Mobile/WebApp.

#### Information Classification Tool

Explore the possibilities to implement Information Organization usually done with
Post Its digitally on a large screen.

Mainly Browser based/Front End.

#### Open Source Browser MindMap

Lot of Information is or can be organized hierarchically. While a lot of Mindmap-Tools
exist, most of them are closed-source with proprietary Data Formats.
The Goal is to develop an open, Browser Based MindMapping-Tool, that uses and
produces Data in various open formats (e.g. json, yaml).

Mainly Browser based/Front End.

#### Practice and Gamification for Programming

In close collaboration with the Lectures for Info2, develop and evaluate game
based programming practice tools for Informatics 2 during the Summer Term.

TBD, Java.

## IMI-Map

#### Internship Portfolios and Presentations

Support the Presentation of recent Internships via the IMI-Map. This can range from
visually attractive Presentations within the IMI-Map to improving communication
channels and information flow between students and supervisors of recent Internships
with those planning their future internships.

Design/Event Organization?/UCD / Rails

#### Internship Approval Process

Approval of Internships based on Certificates and Reports is a complex
process not well supported by the existing systems. It constitutes
an interesting case of business-(il)logic that should be more transparent to
students.

Mostly Rails and UCD.

#### Modernisation of the IMI-Map with React

Identify and implement areas where a more interactive user-experience would help
the user experience and implement them.

React with Rails.
