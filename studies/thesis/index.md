title: Barne Kleinen | Thesis Topics
author: kleinen

---

My main areas of interest are

* Web Technology
* User Centered Design and Usability
* Agile Development
* Continuous Deployment and DevOps


And all intersections of these areas.

If you have an idea for a topic that fits into these areas, come and talk to me.

I'm also happy to supervise topics that are based within a company, but I usually
don't sign NDAs.

The following is a Collection of Ideas for Topics and things that I would like
to see and use.

Most Topics can be done with different focusses on either user research/design,
implementation or evaluation.
