My main areas of interest are

* Web Engineering
* Continuous Deployment and DevOps
* Agile Development
* Learning Support
* Automatic Testing

And especially all intersections of these areas.

If you have an idea for a topic that fits into these areas, come and talk to me.

I'm also happy to supervise topics that are based within a company, but I don't
usually sign NDAs.

The following is a Collection of Ideas for Topics and things that I would like
to see and use.

## Thesis Topics in the area of DevOps

### Visualize the Deployment Pipeline (B/M)
The trend in devops seems to move away from monolithic tools towards a service based
infrastructure. We've recently set up a deployment pipeline for [IMI-Maps](https://github.com/imimaps/imimaps)
using travis, docker, docker hub, ansible, ansible vault and local vms -
a quite complex infrastructure consisting of tools, services and scripts.
While monolitic tools have the possibility to nicely visualize the deployment pipeline,
with a setup like this that's no longer the case. The thesis should try to
find solutions and build a prototype for visualizing a deployment pipeline.
The IMI-Map Deployment can be used as an example.

## IMI and Supporting Learning

### IMI-Dashboard

Identify relevant and important information for IMI-Students and find ways to present it
to them - that might be a dashboard, but also include other forms of hardware.

### Reducing the number of drop-outs
Currently, Master students of the Class WT4 / User Centered Web Design develop
Product Concepts mainly around the goal of reducing the number of drop-outs.
There will be a final presentation of the results on Thursday, 20/7/17, 8:45-12:00 which is
late, but not too late to pick up ideas presented there and turn them into thesis topics.

###  Using Automated Testing for Teaching and Learning: Programming Exercise Feedback
Design a way to provide Feedback for Programming exercises in Informatics 1 and 2.

## Supporting Agile Development

### Open Backlog
Within Scrum, Backlog grooming or Estimation is an important part of the
communication between product owner and team. Backlogs need to be navigated and
prioritized, Storys are annotated and estimated. The goal of this thesis would
be to design and implement a backlog visualization tool that integrates with
other tools to collect tasks/issues, like especially github issues.
