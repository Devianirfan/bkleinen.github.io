## Little Explorations

There are a variety of mobile and web applications out there that provide information about places of interest.

The goal of this project is to create an app that makes it easy to

- combine places of interest from different sources or manually enter them to an individual "places to visit" list
- aid in planning trips, either a short walk, a day long bike trip or a road trip
- act as a social network regarding places; to allow friends to see your exploration plans and share ideas and places.
- also, it should be some kind of exploration/travel diary where
you can document your trips, attach fotos or other media and share this with friends.

Some applications for inspiration

 - [Geocaching](http://geocaching.com/)

### Project Details

The outcome should be an application that can be both used from a desktop computer for collecting information, planning trips and browsing through friend's explorations, as well as be easily
used mobile for spontaneous little explorations.
