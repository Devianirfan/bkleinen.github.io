# Welcome!

This course is an introduction to *algorithms and data structures*. It will be taught in German with all written material in English and with the Java programming language.It will be taught using Java, but it is not about the language. Mastery of basic Java syntax as taught in Informatik I is assumed. We learned primitive data types, statements and rules, interfaces and classes in Informatik I. We will now be looking at more complex data structures and algorithms which work on these data structures.

In particular we will be concentrating on how to solve (small) problems using a programming language. At the end of the semester there will be an introduction to
Ruby so that you get a feel for the language and learn something about differences
in programming languages.

Have a look at how this breaks down to this (tentative) [Schedule](schedule).

## Meetings/Weekly Schedule

The class consists of 2x2h of lectures and 2h of lab:

## Grades

Your grade in Info2 will be a weighted mixture of the evaluated elements of the course (Lecture summaries, lab reports and exam). The partial grades will be assessed as follows and then graded according to the [Grading Scale](({{site.baseurl}}general/grading-scale.html):

TBD!!!!

* Lab reports: 50%
* Exam: 50%

More info about the Lecture Summaries and the Lab Reports can be found on the [Labs](labs) page.

## Exam

There will be a 2-hour online examination on or about July 23. We will have 2 shifts of exams, Group 1 and Group 2.  The exam will be an on-line exam with two parts, a multiple-choice part and an essay / programming part.
