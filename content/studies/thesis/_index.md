## Finding a Topic

My main interest is supervising theses that are tackling a real-world question you encountered e.g. during your internship
or at your workplace. These theses are typically supervised by someone from that company as the second supervisor.

Topics may be:
- accessing and improving some part of a software development or delivery process
- exploring new technology or a new combination of technology to achieve a certain goal (of interest within that company)
- working on accessability or usability issues in the context of the company and their software

Theses topics should be clearly differentiated from typical development tasks within the company. They should explore a new
topic or try to answer a previously unanswered question within the context of work.
