==================

Information for HTW Students

This is the repository behind my web page,

[http://bkleinen.github.io/](http://bkleinen.github.io/)

also available at

[http://people.f4.htw-berlin.de/~kleinen/](http://people.f4.htw-berlin.de/~kleinen/)

If you find information here that is not (yet) linked from your course's page - especially lab exercises -
be aware that I haven't released them yet for the current term, so they might and probably will change at least a bit.

Apart from that, feel free to browse and also send me pull requests if you encounter an error.

## Todo

- have just recent announcements on main page
- settle character encoding on HTW server

  "Pagination: Pagination is enabled, but I couldn't find an index.html page to use as the pagination template. Skipping pagination.""
