You already know refactoring since Info1 - we spent quite some time refactoring the Zuul project!

This e-learning is about exploring and understanding refactoring in more depth. 

The canonical resource on refactoring is Martin Fowler's Book 
"Refactoring, " now also available in a Ruby Version.

The latter is discussed in the [Ruby Rouges Podcast #178](http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/178-rr-book-club-refactoring-ruby-with-martin-fowler).

Martin Fowler has also a web page about refactoring 
[http://refactoring.com](http://refactoring.com) - read through the introductionary (first) page and have a look at the [Refactorings Catalogue](http://refactoring.com/catalog/).

Recall the [Zuul Project from Info1](https://github.com/htw-imi-info1/exercise10). Which refactorings did we do there? Find them in the Catalog.

Open up Eclipse and find the automated refactorings it offers. Find them in the Catalog, and list them.
