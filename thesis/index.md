title: B. Kleinen | Thesis Topics
author: kleinen

---

My main areas of interest are

* agile development
* web engineering
* web development and software engineering
* devops (e.g. provisioning of web applications)
* learning

Thus, if you have a thesis topic idea in these areas you might want to talk to me.

This usually works best if you send an email with a brief description of the topic (a couple of sentences) and come to
see me personally, e.g. during my office hours.


# Some Possible Thesis Topic Ideas

## Coding Feedback

I'm working on automated Feedback for Coding Exercises connected to and independent to Moodle. There are two theses in this area running this semester; it would be great if someone would build on this work. This offers a variety of technical or conceptual topics.

## Museum Infotainment

A former colleague founded [Museotainment](http://www.museotainment.de/) and they are developing a museum guide running on mobile devices. Here are his ideas for possible topics, in german:

- Benutzerführung auf Smartphones für verschiedene Zielgruppen anhand unserer Web-App
- Analyse von unterschiedlichen Designs mit der gleichen Benutzerführung
- Interaktionsformat (eins oder mehrere) entwickeln und erproben (der Praxisbezug ist mir sehr wichtig).
- Benutzerführung zur Orientierung/Navigation mit Smartphone in Innenräumen
- Automatisiertes Testen einer Web-Applikation auf Smartphones

## Online Platform for Learning Networks

It would be great to have an online platform for building learning networks, e.g. finding like-minded people interested in learning the same (tech) topic, for taking an online class together or doing some other form of self-study together. This would be more on the conceptual side.
