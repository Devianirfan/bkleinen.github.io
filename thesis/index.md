title: B. Kleinen | Thesis Topics

My main areas of interest are

* agile development
* web engineering
* web development and software engineering
* devops (e.g. provisioning of web applications)
* learning support
* automatic testing

Thus, if you have a thesis topic idea in these areas you might want to talk to me.

This usually works best if you send an email with a brief description of the topic (a couple of sentences) and come to
see me personally, e.g. during my office hours.

# Some Thesis Topic Ideas

<font color="red">update 3/6/2015: These are old topics that are currently being worked on. Will post new things shortly!</font>

## Programming Exercises Feedback

Create a tool that provides automated feedback for programming exercises for Info1-Info3, where features/key aspects might include one or more of

* feedback for practicing
* Integration with BlueJ
* Automated Grading
* Integration into Moodle
* Ruby or Java
* Integration of Code Quality Metrics
* Highly Interactive Tools
* Actual (Programming) Exercises

## Online Platform for Learning Networks

It would be great to have an online platform for building learning networks, e.g. finding like-minded people interested in learning the same (tech) topic, for taking an online class together or doing some other form of self-study together. This would be more on the conceptual side.

## Scrum Tools

The best setting for an agile team is to be collocated. However, using Scrum within university projects means that this is not always the case. Although there are a couple of commercial options available, there are no or little
lightweight open source solutions for supporting the scrum ceremonies out there.

* Web-based Scrum-Board
* Backlog and Project Planning Tool
* Tools for Agile Retrospectives (probably already taken)

Again, different focus points (Infrastructure, interoperabilty with mobile devices, User Interface, Data Exchange) are possible for these topics.

## Industry Itches

I'm always happy to supervise topics that scratch an actual itch found in the wild in cooperation with a company.
