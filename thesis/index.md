title: B. Kleinen | Thesis Topics
author: kleinen
layout: page
---

My main areas of interest are

* web engineering
* agile development
* web development and software engineering
* devops (e.g. provisioning of web applications)
* learning support
* automatic testing

Thus, if you have a thesis topic idea in these areas you might want to talk to me.

This usually works best if you send an email with a brief description of the topic (a couple of sentences) and come to
see me personally, e.g. during my office hours.

## Industry Itches

I'm always happy to supervise topics that scratch an actual itch found in the wild in cooperation with a company.
